# peep-defence
The code for the Peep Defence game (web-based canvas tower defence with basic pathfinding)

## Outline
A basic tower defence game with basic pathfinding.

## Published version
I have currently published version 1 which is available at http://eclecticapp.xyz/games/peepDefence.php.

## Development version
The new version is being developed and updated on here (v2 branch) but can be tested at http://eclecticapp.xyz/test/tower-defence.php

# Features

## Finished: 

### Levels
New version has 5 different levels, although these will each be uniquely styled in v2

### Waves
New version has 50 waves in total, balanced fairly well with new towers and enemies

### Enemies
New enemy types added and balanced in the development version

## Yet to implement:

### Saving/Loading
This is partially implemented, but needs to be amended with an "opt-out" for privacy

### Leaderboards
Opt-out also needed here, but playerIDs generated and leaderboard scores saved in database on the server

### Brutal enemies
Need a visual indicator of the high-level tough enemies

### Explosions
Some more graphical effects in game, when enemies are destroyed
